# Word2Vec-3D-Embedding-Projector
Using Tensorflow's embedding projector, this setup will give you a locally running interactive 3D visualization of your word2vec model.

To start, install Anaconda Navigator to set up your enviroment for the Jupyter Notebook. With Anaconda installed, you will need a few other installations for your environment. Using Anaconda, install gensim, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, and tensorflow.

Python: 3.7.5
Gensim: 3.8.0
Tensorflow: 1.14.0
Numpy: 1.16.4
Pandas: 0.25.3
Scikit-learn: 0.22

To open a notebook, click on your environment where the above packages are installed and open with Jupyter Notebook. Then you can create a new Python 3 notebook from the webpage it opens.

For this example, you will need to first download the Google News word2vec file found here: https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors
